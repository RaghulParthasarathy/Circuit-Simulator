# Circuit Simulator (DC + Transient Analysis using Modified Nodal Analysis)

This MATLAB-based circuit simulator performs DC and Laplace-domain (transient) analysis using Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA). It supports resistors, capacitors, inductors, and multiple DC voltage sources, allowing users to compute node voltages, component currents, and voltage differences between nodes.

## üöÄ Features

- Supports DC voltage sources, resistors (R), inductors (L), and capacitors (C)
- Uses Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)
- Approximates transient behavior (DC limits: capacitors as open, inductors as short)
- Reads circuit configurations from text files
- Reports node voltages, component currents, and voltage differences
- Well-suited for circuit theory and electrical engineering education

## üìÅ File Structure

- `nodalAnalysis.m`: Core function implementing MNA for solving the circuit
- `nodalAnalysisScript.m`: File I/O and result display wrapper for `nodalAnalysis.m`
- `example_circuit.txt`: Sample input file (user-provided or to be created)
  
## üìÑ Input File Format
